                <h2>Key Functions & Importance</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Intelligent Code Assistance:</strong> AI-powered tools suggest code snippets, detect bugs, and even generate functions based on natural language descriptions.</li>
                    <li><strong>Automated Testing:</strong> AI can generate test cases, perform regression testing, and identify potential failure points more efficiently than manual processes.</li>
                    <li><strong>Project Management:</strong> AI helps in estimating project timelines, allocating resources, and predicting risks based on historical data.</li>
                    <li><strong>Enhanced User Experience:</strong> Integrating AI features like chatbots, recommendation engines, and personalization into applications.</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Future Scope</h2>
                <p>The future points towards AI-augmented software engineering where developers focus on high-level architecture and problem-solving while AI handles coding, debugging, and optimization. This will lower the barrier to entry and dramatically increase the speed and quality of software delivery.</p>
